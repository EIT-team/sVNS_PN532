2) Verify and upload latest version of the INO sketch to Arduino UNO or equivalent board.

Operates on the Serial interface (Serial Monitor) with 115200 baud rate. 

Please ensure the correct rate (115200) is selected when starting the Serial Monitor.

Please follow the commands as instructed, i.e. when prompted for confirmation send exactly ONE character or just press "Enter" button once (without any character). 

Failure to do so (i.e. pressing Enter twice or sending a character with an Enter button when confirming will transfer the last command to the consequent instruction).

If a mistake was made during the input, just close and re-open the Serial Monitor. 

If just a memory read is required, just close and re-open the Serial Monitor.
